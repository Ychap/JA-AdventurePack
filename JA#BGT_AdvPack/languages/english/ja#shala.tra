@3    = ~Rumors, is it? Well, for what it's worth, beware the Seven Suns trading coster. Something about them isn't right... But I shouldn't divulge a city's secrets to a strangerâ€”the walls have ears. Enjoy your stay in this lonely place, friends, for I get the sense that I should leave you now.~

@4    = ~You too, then. Some days I can sense death hanging over this city like a pall. It will claim us all someday, and I doubt a drink will stop it. But I'm not here to lecture you. Fare thee well, friend, and I hope you find whatever it is you're seeking here.~
