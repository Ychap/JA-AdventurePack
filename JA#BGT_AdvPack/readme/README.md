## Introduction

This mod expands upon the content of the Baldur's Gate game.
There is a lot of content in BG1 that did not make it into the final game. The mod "BG1 Unfinished Business" restores some of them, but there are a lot more still. In addition, there are many instances in the game where the impression arises that something is missing or that it was not implemented completely.

This Adventure Pack adds to such points in the game. A lot of missing content not included in "BG1 UB" is restored by this mod, and situations that seemed meager are expanded upon. Still, there would be a lot more unused content to be found in the game. The more I worked with the BG1 files, the more instances I encountered.

Additionally to restorations and expansions this mod introduces some of my own ideas. For a detailed list of the content please refer to the section [Components](#components) below.

## Hints & Notes

Note the following to see as much mod content as possible:

- Spare / defend Aldeth's life in the Cloakwood to see all the extended restored material for the Mearchants' League.
- Talk to Husam whenever you might see him.
- For pacifying Caldo and Krumm it needs a bit of imagination. ;)
- The plot inside the Ducal Palace is different now and more extended!

### Spoiler:

<details>
  <summary><b>If fighting Marl inside Feldepost's Inn the guards appear. How can I prevent this?</b></summary>
    Keep to the unwritten laws for tavern brawls, meaning: no weapons and only one opponent against one! Best to turn off group-AI during this fight.
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>The Iron Throne Building is locked. How do I get inside?</b></summary>
    Ask the drunk Husam for advice. Also, search inside the houses nearby.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>How can the desk inside the Mearchants' League be opened?</b></summary>
    You need to pick-pocket the key from Zorl. Zorl can be sent away after talking to Irlentree on the first level, then the desk can be opened without consequences.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Sarevok's Journal no longer is with Cythandria in the Iron Throne Building?</b></summary>
    No, Sarevok's journal will be inside the Ducal Palace.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Why is the scene inside the Ducal Palace not starting?</b></summary>
    To start the scene, you need to go and pick Sarevok's journal from the second level. Nila will help you with this. Also, if expecting help from Husam, you need to grant him and his Shadow Thieves access to the palace, first (via the cellars).
